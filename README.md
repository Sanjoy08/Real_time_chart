# Real-Time Chart

Real-Time Chart is a web application that demonstrates real-time data visualization using a line chart. This project utilizes Chart.js to create and update a dynamic chart that displays changing data values over time.

## Features

- Real-Time Data Visualization: Displays a line chart that updates with new data points at regular intervals.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your code editor.
3. Run the application by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.
4. Explore the real-time chart that dynamically updates with random data values.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Chart.js

## Usage

### Real-Time Chart

The main feature of this application is the real-time line chart that visualizes data values changing over time. Here's how it works:

- The chart is initialized with an empty dataset.
- The `addData` function generates random data points and adds them to the chart at regular intervals.
- The chart updates every second with a new data point.

Feel free to customize the chart's appearance and behavior by modifying the code in `index.js`.
